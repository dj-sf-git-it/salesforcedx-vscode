# Lightning Web Components for Visual Studio Code

This extension provides code-editing features for the Lightning Web Components programming model, which is part of the Lightning Component framework. It uses the default HTML language server from VS Code to provide syntax highlighting, code completion, an outline view of your files, and a Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) linter.

We provide salesforce-vscode-lwc to selected customers through a pilot program that requires agreement to specific terms and conditions. salesforce-vscode-lwc is subject to change and isn’t generally available unless or until Salesforce announces its general availability in documentation or in press releases or public statements. We can’t guarantee general availability within any particular time frame or at all. Make your purchase decisions only on the basis of generally available products and features.
